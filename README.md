wxTrac Attachments Repository
=============================

This read-only repository contains attachments imported from the old
[Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org/) installation used for tracking wxWidgets
issues and is referenced by the issues in the main wxWidgets/wxWidgets
repository.

It was created by copying the `files/attachments/ticket` directory contents
from the old wxTrac installation and shouldn't be modified any longer now that
wxTrac is not used any more.

There is no reason to ever use it directly or clone it neither.
