+Mac Classic (e.g. Mac OS 8.x/9.x) as Carbon or Cocoa applications.
 However the Mac OS X port is the most actively developed one, and Mac Classic
 will not be supported after 2.6. wxMac works best with Mac OS X 10.3 and
 above.</p>

 <h3>What can I do if I get conflicts between different installed versions of wxWidgets?</h3>
 
+<p>For most development work, this is not an issue.  You can have many versions of wxWidgets on your computer at the same time without conflict.  You will only encounter this problem if you try to install wxWidgets into /usr/local/bin.</p>

 <p>Some versions of Mac OS X install an older version of wxMac than the one
 you may be using for development. This can cause conflicts, such as link
 errors when building your applications. A user reports:</p>
