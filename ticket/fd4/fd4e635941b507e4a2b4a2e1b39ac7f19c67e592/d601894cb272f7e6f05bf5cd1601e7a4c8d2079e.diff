+\wxheading{The difference between {\tt EVT_SCROLL_THUMBRELEASE} and {\tt EVT_SCROLL_ENDSCROLL}}
+
+The {\tt EVT_SCROLL_THUMBRELEASE} event is only emitted when actually dragging
+the thumb using the mouse and releasing it (This {\tt EVT_SCROLL_THUMBRELEASE}
+event is also followed by an {\tt EVT_SCROLL_ENDSCROLL} event).
+
+The {\tt EVT_SCROLL_ENDSCROLL} event also occurs when using the keyboard to
+change the thumb position, and when clicking next to the thumb (In all these
+cases the {\tt EVT_SCROLL_THUMBRELEASE} event does not happen).
+
+In short, the {\tt EVT_SCROLL_ENDSCROLL} event is triggered when scrolling/
+moving has finished. The only exception (unfortunately) is that changing the
+thumb position using the mousewheel does give a {\tt EVT_SCROLL_THUMBRELEASE}
+event but NOT an {\tt EVT_SCROLL_ENDSCROLL} event.
+
+Please see the widgets sample ("Slider" page) to see the difference
+between {\tt EVT_SCROLL_THUMBRELEASE} and {\tt EVT_SCROLL_ENDSCROLL} in action.
