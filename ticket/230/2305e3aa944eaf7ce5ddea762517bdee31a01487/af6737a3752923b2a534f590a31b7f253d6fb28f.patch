Subject: [PATCH] Don't put client coordinates into wxWindowGTK::m_x/m_y, they
 want virtual coordinates.

Fixes GetPosition() reporting different numbers than what was given to SetSize() in a scrolled window and spurious events generated when SetSize() is called with the position that the control already is at (regression introduced by r74074).

Fixes #15444.
