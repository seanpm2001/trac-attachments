This patch adds event loop and wxTimer support to wxBase for unix and msw build. It can be 
used same way as GUI application.

Things implemented:
 - wxApp class
Linux:
 - mainloop implementation using select() call (linux)
 - mainloop implementation using epoll() call (linux)
 - wxTimer
 - various wxSocket thread safety improvements 
 - wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent from unix signal handler secured
Windows:
 - mainloop implementation using WSAWaitForMultipleEvents (windows)
 - wxTimer and wxSocket code reused from GUI version
ALL:
 - sample for socket class (samples/sockbase)

How to use it: 
 - downolad and install bakefile 0.2.1.
 - download wxWidgets 2.8.0
 - copy file to wxWidgets dir 
 - patch sources: patch -p1 < zork-mainloop-p22-for-2_8_0.patch 
 - regenerate makefiles using bakefile: 

Linux:
 cd $WXDIR;
 aclocal -I build/aclocal
 cd $WXDIR/build/bakefile;
 bakefile_gen -f autoconf
 cd $WXDIR;
 autoconf
 
MSW:
 cd $WXDIR\build\bakefile
 bakefile_gen -f msvc,msvc6prj

- configure and build wxWidgets as usual.

Unix configure will use epoll if detected. If you want to use select() based inplementation then disable HAVE_EPOLL in config.h after running configure.
There is new sample in samples/sockbase that contains client and server program to test sockets and timers. You can use this sample to do stress tests too.
