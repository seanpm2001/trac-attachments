+   GCC >= 4.2 supports visibility attribute also for non-Windows builds
+
+   NOTE: theorically also GCC 4.0 and 4.1 support the visibility attribute
+         but these versions also give a warning when the attribute is used
+         on forward declarations. Since (to avoid MSVC warnings) we use
+         WXIMPORT/WXEXPORT also on forward declarations, we would get a
+         ton of warnings if we enable visibility support with GCC 4.[1|2]!
