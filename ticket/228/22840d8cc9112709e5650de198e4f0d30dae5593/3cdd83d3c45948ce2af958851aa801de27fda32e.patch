+    On Mac OS X in the open file dialog the filter choice box is not shown by default.
+    Instead all given wildcards are appplied at the same time: So in the above 
+    example all bmp, gif and png files are displayed. To enforce the 
+    display of the filter choice set the corresponding wxSystemOptions before calling
+    the file open dialog:
+    @code
+         wxSystemOptions::SetOption(wxOSX_FILEDIALOG_ALWAYS_SHOW_TYPES, 1)
+    @endcode
+    But in contrast to Windows and Unix, where the file type choice filters only
+    the selected files, on Mac OS X even in this case the dialog shows all files
+    matching all file types. The files which does not match the currently selected
+    file type are greyed out and are not selectable.
