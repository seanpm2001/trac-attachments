-         We need to re-define the resource compiler, used by bakefile when compiling
-         resources, to the resource compiler returned by 'wx-config &#45;-rescomp' since
-         'wx-config &#45;-rescomp' returns both the name of the resource compiler to use
-         and the flags required for that compiler (rcflags are rccompiler-specific
-         and thus it would be wrong to use them with other resource compilers).
+         We need to re-define the WINDRES resource compiler name to the resource compiler
+         returned by 'wx-config - -rescomp' since this option returns both the name of the
+         resource compiler to use (windres) and the flags required for that compiler.
 
          This line typically does something *only* when the Makefile.in generated
          using this bakefile, is used on Windows with MSYS (when using Cygwin, resources
          are not compiled at all).
+         Without this line, in fact, when compiling with MSYS on Windows, the - -include-dir
+         option which tells windres to look in wxWidgets\include folder would be missing and
+         then windres would fail to find the wxMSW resources.
 
-         NOTE: overwriting the RESCOMP variable we modify the entire Bakefile behaviour
-               for resource compilation; this could be a problem if the bakefile which
-               includes this file needs the standard Bakefile resource compiler to
-               build a non wx-based application.
+         NOTE: overwriting the WINDRES variable we add wxWidgets resource flags to
+               all targets which include this bakefile; this could be useless to those
+               targets which are not wx-based eventually present in that bakefile but
+               in any case it shouldn't do any harm.
