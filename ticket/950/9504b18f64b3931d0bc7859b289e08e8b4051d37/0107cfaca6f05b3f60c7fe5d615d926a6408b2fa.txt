MSW
When creating a popupwindow (using wxTipWindow e.g.), the window
is first created at the top-left of the screen. This is expected,
because the documentation of ::CreateWindowEx says that for a popup
window CW_USEDEFAULT for position is changed to 0,0. However, it
is not nice that the window can first be seen at the top left of
the screen, before it is moved to the right location. This requires
the window to be created without WS_VISIBLE.

wxPopupTransientWindow::wxPopupTransientWindow (common/popupcmn.cpp)
  calls
wxPopupWindow::Create (msw/popupwin.cpp)
  which then calls
wxWindowMSW::Create (msw/window.cpp)
  This sets the windows createion flags using:
    DWORD msflags = MSWGetCreateWindowFlags(&exstyle);
  which always sets WS_VISIBLE
  And then:
    if ( IsShown() )
    {
        msflags |= WS_VISIBLE;
    }
  which is not very useful. Better is:
    if ( IsShown() )
    {
        msflags |= WS_VISIBLE;
    }
	else
	{
        msflags &= ~WS_VISIBLE;
	}
  This allows popup windows to be created invivibly.
