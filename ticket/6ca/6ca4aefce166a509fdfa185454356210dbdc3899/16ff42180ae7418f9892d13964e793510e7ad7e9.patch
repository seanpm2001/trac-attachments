+wxWidgets for Mac OS X installation
+-----------------------------------
 
-On MacOS X, you can download Apple's free developer tools (gcc
-and associated headers and libraries, such as the Carbon API).
-You can then use configure in a similar way to compiling
-wxWidgets on Linux (or on Windows using MinGW or Cygwin). See
-'Apple Developer Tools' below for more details on using
-configure.
+wxWidgets can be compiled using Apple's Carbon or Cocoa libraries.
+Carbon is the older library, and Cocoa is the more modern library.
 
+In wxWidgets 2.9.x, Cocoa is the recommended library.  While Carbon is still
+supported by Apple, little new work is being done in Carbon.
 
-Apple Developer Tools: command line
------------------------------------
+Most Mac OS X developers should start by downloading and installing Xcode 
+from http://developer.apple.com.  It is a free IDE from Apple that provides
+all of the tools you need for working with wxWidgets.
 
-As in all Unix projects, you need to do something like this under MacOS X
-with the Apple Developer Tools installed:
+After Xcode is installed, download either wxWidgets-{version}.tar.gz or 
+wxMac-{version}.tar.gz and then double-click on it to unpack it to create 
+a wxWidgets directory.
 
-1) cd into the base dir
-2) mkdir osx-build
-3) cd osx-build
-4) ../configure (add --with-osx_cocoa for the Cocoa port)
-5) make
+Next use Terminal (under Applications, Utilities, Terminal) to access a command 
+prompt.  Use cd to change directories to your wxWidgets directory and execute 
+one of the following sets of commands from the wxWidgets directory
 
+---------
+
+# Build the library for Cocoa (wxWidgets 2.9.0 and later)
+mkdir build-cocoa-debug
+cd build-cocoa-debug
+../configure --enable-unicode --enable-debug --disable-shared --with-osx_cocoa
+make;cd ..
+# Build the samples and demos
+cd build-cocoa-debug/samples; make;cd ../..
+cd build-cocoa-debug/demos;   make;cd ../..
+
+---------
+
+# Build the library for Carbon
+mkdir build-carbon-debug
+cd build-carbon-debug
+../configure --enable-unicode --enable-debug --disable-shared
+make;cd ..
+# Build the samples and demos
+cd build-carbon-debug/samples;make;cd ../..
+cd build-carbon-debug/demos;  make;cd ../..
+
+---------
+
+After the compilation completes, use Finder to run the samples and demos
+  Go to build-carbon-debug/samples to experiment with the Carbon samples.
+  Go to build-carbon-debug/demos to experiment with the Carbon demos.
+  Go to build-cocoa-debug/samples to experiment with the Cocoa samples.
+  Go to biuld-cocoa-debug/demos to experiment with the Cocoa demos.
+Double-click on the executables which have an icon showing three small squares.
+The source code for the samples is in wxWidgets/samples
+The source code for the demos is in wxWidgets/demos
+

+
+More information about building on Mac OS X is available in the wxWiki.
+Here are two useful links

 If you want to install the library into the system directories you'll need
 to do this as root.  The accepted way of running commands as root is to
 use the built-in sudo mechanism.  First of all, you must be using an
