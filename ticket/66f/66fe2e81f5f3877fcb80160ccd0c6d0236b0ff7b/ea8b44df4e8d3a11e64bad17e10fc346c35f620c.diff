-Borland C++ 5.5 compilation
----------------------------
-
-Before compiling wxWindows with Borland C++ 5.5, there are a few 
-issues concerning the compiler installation: 
-
-1. The compiler must be installed to a path that does not contain 
-   spaces, such as c:\Borland\Bcc55 (in particular, do not install 
-   it below "C:\Program Files").
-
-2. Make sure that you downloaded and installed the service pack 1 
-   for Borland C++ 5.5.  This SP1 can be downloaded from:
-   http://www.borland.com/devsupport/bcppbuilder/patches/#freecompiler55
-
-   IMPORTANT:
-   When installing SP1, make sure that you extract (UnZip) the files 
-   to the directory where you installed Borland C++ 5.5 (e.g., 
-   c:\Borland\Bcc55) with the option "use folder names" selected. 
-   This is necessary, to ensure that the files (mostly include files) 
-   are extracted to the right directory.
-
-3. Create the following two files in the same directory where you 
-   installed Borland C++ 5.5 (e.g., c:\Borland\Bcc55):
-
-   a. bcc32.cfg
-      text file containing the following two lines:
-      -I"c:\Borland\Bcc55\include"
-      -L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"
-
-   b. ilink32.cfg
-      text file containing the following line:
-      -L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"
-
-   (replace c:\Borland\Bcc55 with the actual path where you installed 
-   Borland C++ 5.5)
-
-4. Add the borland BIN directory to your path (e.g., c:\Borland\Bcc55\bin), 
-   and define the environment variable BCCDIR=<Borland C++ 5.5 path>
-   (e.g., set BCCDIR=c:\Borland\Bcc55)
-
-Compiling wxWindows:
-
-Once the compiler and its service pack are properly installed, you build 
-wxWindows using the provided makefile.b32 in the src/msw directory:
-
-a. To build wxWindows in DEBUG mode:
-
-    cd c:\wx2\src\msw
-    make -f makefile.b32
-
-    (replace c:\wx2 with the actual path where you installed wxWindows)
-
-b. To build wxWindows in RELEASE mode:
-
-    cd c:\wx2\src\msw
-    make -f makefile.b32 FINAL=1   
-
-    (if you had previously built wxWindows, you need to clean all of
-    the object and intermediate files.  Before the above make command, 
-    run: 'make -f makefile.b32 CLEANALL')
-
-IMPORTANT:
-The Service Pack 1 for Borland C++ 5.5 must be installed before wxWindows 
-is compiled.  If you compiled wxWindows before, it is advised that you 
-re-compile it following the next steps:
-
-    cd c:\wx2\src\msw
-    make -f makefile.b32 CLEANALL
-    make -f makefile.b32   (or make -f makefile.b32 FINAL=1)
-
-    (replace c:\wx2 with the actual path where you installed wxWindows)
