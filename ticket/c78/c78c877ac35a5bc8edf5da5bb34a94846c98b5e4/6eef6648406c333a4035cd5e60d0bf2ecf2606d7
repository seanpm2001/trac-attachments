This patch fixes a problem with the Forth Thieves demo when compiled
with wxGTK.  It has *NOT* been tested with any other environment.

When the game is one, two "Do you wish to play again?" dialog boxes 
appear: one when the last card is moved into place, and one when the
user moves the mouse to click "Yes" or "No".  This also causes the
"Games won" counter to be incremented twice for every game won.

These problems are because the code to check if a game is won was in
the FortyCanvas::SetCursorStyle() routine.  Moving it to the end of
the Game::DoMove() fixed this bug.

This patch also fixes a bug where the screen was not fully redrawn 
if the user answers "Yes" to play another game.

There are two lines of code where 4 spaces were replaced with a tab.

Finally, this patch also redraws the score box after the user has
won to show the incremented "Games won" counter.  This is an added
feature with seemed to make sense to add.
