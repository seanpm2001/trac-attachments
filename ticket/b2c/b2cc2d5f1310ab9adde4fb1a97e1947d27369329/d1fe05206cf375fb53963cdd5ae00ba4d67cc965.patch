 \twocolitem{msw.notebook.themed-background}{If set to 0, globally disables themed backgrounds on notebook
 pages. Note that this won't disable the theme on the actual notebook background (noticeable only if there are no
 pages).}
-\twocolitem{msw.staticbitmap.htclient}{If set to 1, allows the static bitmap to respond to mouse
-events. The default is 0, since a value of 1 can interfere with refresh in static boxes. Note that once set,
-this option cannot be unset later in the application.}
 \twocolitem{msw.staticbox.optimized-paint}{If set to 0, switches off optimized wxStaticBox painting.
 Setting this to 0 causes more flicker, but allows applications to paint graphics on the parent of a static box
 (the optimized refresh causes any such drawing to disappear).}
