     context menu event handler is not being called, you could call wxEvent::Skip()
     for mouse right-down events.
 
+    The details of context menu event creation are different across platforms:
+    Under wxMSW, they are created after unprocessed right button up events,
+    under wxGTK, they are created after unprocessed right button down events,
+    under wxOSX, they are created after Ctrl+Click.
+    If you want to deal with *both* right-click events as well as context menus
+    portably (e.g. always create context menu events following a right up event),
+    it is recommended to not use EVT_CONTEXT_MENU events at all but instead create
+    the context menus in (e.g.) the right button up handlers.
+
     @beginEventTable{wxContextMenuEvent}
     @event{EVT_CONTEXT_MENU(func)}
         A right click (or other context menu command depending on platform) has been detected.
